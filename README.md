# processing-spinners
This sketch draws a pattern of two types of rectangles and a wedge shape 
that spin when clicked.
Pressing the ENTER key stops all spinning; SPACE resets to starting state.
Using an object class makes it easy to change the kind of shapes that are drawn.
Storing the objects in an array simplifies the code.
Written in Processing 1.5 in 2012; also runs in 2.2.1.
