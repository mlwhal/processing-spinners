# processing-spinners
This sketch draws a pattern of two types of rectangles and a wedge shape 
that spin when clicked.
Pressing the ENTER key stops all spinning; SPACE resets to starting state.
Using an object class makes it easy to change the kind of shapes that are drawn.
Storing the objects in an array simplifies the code.
